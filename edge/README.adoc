= Edge

For newcomers to the Clojure language it can be quite a daunting task to put together a real Clojure application from scratch.

That's why we've done this initial step for you and creating a project that you can learn from and build upon.

This isn't merely a toy application. Edge represents JUXT's latest
thinking on the baseline architecture which we use for our own
professional Clojure projects. The name is taken from

== Features

Edge is a simple project demonstrating the integration of the following:

== Getting started

Please see the <<app/README#>> for building and running the app.

== Why the `app` directory?

The rationale for using a sub-directory here is to allow for multiple
modules in a single repository. See <<docs/layout#>> for more details.
